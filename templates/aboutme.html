     <h2 class="text_me">About ME</h2>
        <p class="text_aboutme col-lg-12 col-sm-2">My name is Franciscoelias, but everyone calls me Cisco. I entered the world
        of coding 2021 with a online Udemy course "Python Bootcamp". Since then,I have become familiar with programs
         such as Tkinter, Flask, Turtle, GitHub, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, SQLite. I have created some
        <a href="{{url_for('projects')}}">projects</a> through my course, as well as individual projects that I have displayed
          on <a href="https://github.com/CiscoMerchan" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I have also joined a Meetup group called Python Beginners ,where I have done a
          presentation online (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY7pSCeF_Rg&t=13s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>)of a step-by-step on how to create a log-in form using Flask and
          FLaskForm for beginners.</p>

        <p class="text_aboutme">Coding is a fascinating domain for me, that I wish I found sooner. Being fluent in English,
        Spanish and French (and conversational in others), I can't help but draw similarities between coding and learning a
        language, something I really enjoy. There is always something new to learn, and constant problem-solving are other
        aspects of coding that really appeal to me. <!--#####(just to name a few.--></p>
<!--        <br>-->
        <p class="text_aboutme">My previous work experience as a Scuba Diving Instructor, and a manager in hospitality have
        required of me a high level of dedication and self-motivation, professional work etiquette, ability to work under
        pressure and meet deadlines and a high level of communication skill with people from all works of life. </p>
<!--        <br>-->
        <p class="text_aboutme">In my spare time you can find me sailing, or scuba diving, reading about history, and of
        course with my family. </p>

        <p class="text_aboutme">Kind regards, Cisco</p>
